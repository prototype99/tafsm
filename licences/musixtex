 MusiXTeX may be freely copied, duplicated and used. However, since it is
intended to be a "no cost software" you are not allowed to sell it, and the fee
you may ask for distributing it must be limited to maintenance, support and
duplication costs. You may take it or parts of it to include in other
packages, but no packages called MusiXTeX may be distributed under this name
if different from the original distribution (except obvious bug corrections).

 Adaptations for specific implementations (e.g. fonts) should be provided as
separate additional TeX or LaTeX files which override original definition.

 MusiXTeX may be included in further commercial packages, provided that no
additional fee is charged for MusiXTeX itself.
